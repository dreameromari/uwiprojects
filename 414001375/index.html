figure of $523 billion in 2020 in revenue. These figures bode a promising prospect.Threat of substitutes can be diminished using the online content driven by bonus incentives.Observing market share carefully by looking at risk levels and 
managing levels at which increases in market share being occupied no longer bring profit. Since the industry is ever evolving new ventures can be birthed into forming beyond the traditional way of succeeding in this industry.
