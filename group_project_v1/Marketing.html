			<p>
				As we progress with the updates of our service we aim to keep our clients interested by regular layout changes, website upgrades and
				New offers. When the 6 month trial has concluded, they would be more than willing to pay our fee of $20.00 per month as they recognize 
				the quality of the product.  We allow our clients to use their debit/credit cards as payment for our product.  It is also acceptable to 
				use PayPal as a method of payment, as it is recognized that all students may not have access to a credit card. If a client needs to register
				for a PayPal account, to make it easier on them, the link or sign-in feature is offered on our website. After payment you are directed to the 
				installation tutorial and file where your very own back-pack will be installed on your device.

				our product 1 year, free of charge, in exchange for him recommending the app and itsâ€™ remarkable features to those he comes into contact 
				with, and also on his social media platforms; especially if it proves to be beneficial to his student life.
