    <p ID = "PreAmb"> Ofcourse you may be wondering just how Back Pack provides the proposed
        solution. Allow us to walk you through the process.</p>

    <div ID = "Mockup">
    <p class = "words" ID = "First"> When you download the application to your phone, laptop or iPad for the first time you will be
        presented with a sign in screen. Where we'll requeste you to enter your
        name, e-mail and phone number. We use this information to create a
        profile for you as well as recommend friends who may already be using
        the application.</p>

    <img class = "image" src ="images/Course-Creation.png" alt = "Course Creation">
    <p class = "words" ID = "SignUp"> After signing up for the service, a first time, free user is offered up
        to four courses to customise. You'll be allowed to customize each course
        to by choosing a color to represent it as well as an icon. Say hi to James!
        He's a first your chemistry student at university. Let's follow his sign
        up experience.</p>



    <p class = "words" ID = "dashboard"> After completing the sign up experience you will be greeted with a home
        dashboard alot like this one. As you can see James has used the application
        for quite some time and has alot going on. Hopefully that group research
        project goes well.</p>

    <p class = "words" ID = "Value">Now, in order to show you the true value of Your Back Pack we need to take a
       peak at James' weekly schedule. He won't mind.</p>



    <p class = "words" ID = "Explain" >As you can see James has alot of free time. Usually, James would have to
       pull his hair out managing and optimising this free time but BP
       does all of this for him. All he has to do is take notes in his note notebook
       like he normally would and schedule his tests.Furthermore, if he simply
       takes note of a tests or homework in a nootbook, BP while be able to
       assign timeslots where the homework is due or the test is scheduled. Moreover,
       how would James know the optimum time to study? Well he doesn't have to worry
       about that. BP knows you and your learning style and generates a perfect
       schedule for each user. Notice how most of James' suggested sessions start around 8, this is because
       BP knows that James' optimal study time is 8am. Furthermore, James starts a
       bit slow on the weekend so BP adjusts for that.</p>
