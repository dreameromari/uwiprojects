		<h2> Our Problem </h2>
		<p>The life of a student, the confusion, the struggle to remained organized and constantly between apps and notebook
		We all have our choice of clutter apps for different purposes. Google calendar, OneNote, Microsoft word for our essays.
		As much as these apps help us, they do not sync with each other. From app to app, opening and closing tabs and windows.
		What if all in one place could we do everything organized with less clutter? This personal assistant is for us, for you
		and for everyone. </p>
